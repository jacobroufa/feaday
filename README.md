# Front End a Day

A simple framework to make doing a front-end project each day easy and fun.

My vision for this project is to be able to run a script that generates a basic template with whatever front-end focused framework I want to be learning, so that I can easily track my progress in a simple and easy to understand format.

## Installing

Run `npm install && npm run project` to create your project. Follow the prompts.

## Available commands

+ `npm run project` will create a new project for you. When your project is created, the first day is automatically built and the watcher started for you to begin.
+ `npm run day` will begin a new day for your project, starting a watcher to make sure your changes are hinted.
+ `npm run watch` will watch your scripts and templates for changes and hint/compile them for you.

## Coming soon

+ Simple static server with livereload
+ Scripts that actually do things

This is just the beginning. Right now this doesn’t do anything but I’m hoping that it will soon...
